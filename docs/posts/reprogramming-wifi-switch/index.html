    <p>My condo&rsquo;s living room is&hellip;challenging from a lighting and electric
standpoint. It&rsquo;s about 18&rsquo; by 21&rsquo;, with ceilings that slope down from
22&rsquo; at one side to 11&rsquo; from the other. There is a light switch in
one corner, connected to a single outlet about 8&rsquo; away. If I want that
light switch to control several lights at various parts of the room,
someone would have to run wiring around ~40&rsquo; of wall, over doorways
and through studs. Another condo is below mine, and the roof is above,
so neither attic or basement is an option for running wires. And did
I mention that the studs seem to be metal?</p>

<p>Instead, I decided to use relays connected to ESP-8266 wifi-enabled
microcontrollers to control the lights. As a simple proof-of-concept,
I wrote a switch program that would turn on the relay when I made a
GET request to <code>&lt;esp8266 ip&gt;/on</code> and keep it on for 11 seconds, Then
I programmed a &ldquo;sensor&rdquo; ESP-8266 to call each of the <code>/on</code> endpoints
every few seconds for as long as it was turned on. I plugged it into
the outlet controlled by the light switch, and connected the lights
to the relays. Now, when I turned on the light switch, it would
activate the sensor chip, which would tell the other chips to turn
on their lights. When I turned off the light switch, the sensor chip
would stop sending &ldquo;turn on&rdquo; requests to the others, which would time
out after 11 seconds and turn their lights off. It&rsquo;s not a sophisticated
system, but it worked.</p>

<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the amount of hardware required, however. For
each outlet I wanted to control, I needed to use one ESP8266 (powered
by a wall wart) and one relay (plugged into an always-on outlet. That
meant that I needed two plugs, or one full outlet per light. I&rsquo;ve always
avoided building electronics that run on mains power, so I was using
nice Digital Loggers relays, which seemed like overkill at $23 each.
Adding in an ESP8266 and power supply, the BOM for the project to
control 3 lights was around $80. Not to mention it looked bad to have
the exposed ESP chips hanging off their power supplies, with tiny
wires leading in to the relay inputs.</p>

<p>What I wanted was a solution that integrated a programmable ESP-8266,
power supply, and relay into a nice, clean, UL-listed package that I
wouldn&rsquo;t be embarassed to have plugged in to an outlet in my living
room. Fortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t the first person to have this idea, and
a kind soul at <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/20316-wifi-outlet-hacking">hackaday.io</a>
had already identified a type of mass-produced, reliable-looking wifi
outlet that used an ESP-8266. I picked up two for $24. These came
programmed to be controlled by an android or ios app, but I never
give my wifi password to devices unless I can program them myself or
trust them to be updated regularly. Besides, it just seems crazy to
me that a request to turn on a light in my house would ever need
to leave my local network.</p>

<p>The only ESP-8266 module I&rsquo;ve ever used is the beginner-friendly
NodeMcu boards. To program them, all you have to do is plug them
into a computer with a mini USB cable. I was nervous about whether
I&rsquo;d be able to figure out how to program a less beginner-friendly
chip already mounted on a larger board.</p>

<p>When the wifi outlets came, I cracked one open and saw that I was
looking at close to a best-case scenario. One of the well-known
ESP-12 modules was mounted on one corner of the board, nicely
labeled and with a fairly wide margin around it, making it
fairly accessible to probing. I didn&rsquo;t know <em>how</em> I was going to
reprogram it, but I didn&rsquo;t see any obvious dealbreakers. I also
noticed that many of the pads on the ESP-12 module did not seem
to be connected to the rest of the board at all, which made sense
if it only needed to use one or two IO pins. That would also make
it easier to reason about.</p>

<p>Step one was to figure out exactly how it worked, to ensure that
I&rsquo;d be able to control the relay if I could reprogram the chip.
I plugged it in. The single button on the circuit board works
as an on / off switch, which was very helpful. From the ESP-12
module diagram I found online, I could identify the VCC and GND
pads. As a sanity check, I measured the voltage between VCC and
GND, and found it was the expected 3.3V. Perfect! I then measured
the difference between GND and  each other pad, first with the
relay off, and then with it on. This quickly revealed the simple
system design. GPIO 12 directly controlled the relay. When it was
at 3.3V, the relay was closed and the outlet was powered. When it
was 0V, the relay was open and the outlet was off. GPIO 13 was
configured as a normally-high input pin. It sat at 3.3V, but if I
shorted it to ground, the relay state would toggle. This is how
the button controlled the relay.</p>

<p>Now that I knew <em>what</em> I wanted the chip to do, it was time to figure
out <em>how</em> to program it. Again, smart, generous people on the internet
came through for me. A <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Getting-Started-with-the-ESP8266-ESP-12/">nicely detailed instructable</a>
shows exactly how to wire a freestanding ESP-12 module for programming.
I wasn&rsquo;t about to do surgery on the board, but I had heard that in-circuit
programming is often possible, so I was optimistic.</p>

<p>The next challenge was wiring the chip for programming. One obvious
choice was to solder wires to the pads and use those. I didn&rsquo;t like
that plan. For one thing, I&rsquo;m not very good at soldering. For another,
the pads are both very close to each other and also (on one side of the
chip) close to the plastic housing. I would not have been able to solder
the wires on that side without melting and burning the case. Finally,
if I was able to reprogram this device, I&rsquo;d want to reprogram <em>many</em>
of them, so I wanted a non-destructive way to reprogram them quickly
and reliably.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d heard of something called a &ldquo;bed of nails&rdquo; programming device, which
is a special programming or testing apparatus consisting of a flat board
with special spring-loaded pins sticking out of it. When a circuit board
is clamped down onto the bed of nails, the spring-loaded pins make contact
with test pads on the circuit board, allowing the user to program or test
the circuit[0]. I figured that I would be able to 3D print something that
would allow me to use the bits of breadboard wires and hookup wire I already
had available as a rudimentary bed of nails.</p>

<p>This was my introduction to just how demanding the tolerances for electronice
really are.  I iterated through 12 different designs for my bed of nails
block. First, I thought I could use breadboard wire that already had little pins
at the end. But between the varying lengths of the pins and the need to angle
the wires in a fan to accound for the thickness of the insulation, this failed
quickly. Next I started using single-strand hookup wire. Again, any design that
relied on the length of the uninsulated tip of the wire proved too unreliable.
Finally I tried a design with two tiny holes for each wire, so that a loop
at the bottom of the block would contact the pad. Even this was too uneven for
all the necessary wires to make contact at the same time.</p>

<p>Another issue I ran into was the precision limits of my 3D printer. The holes for the
wires needed to be around 1mm. The nozzle on my 3D printer is 0.4mm. In practice,
this means that the &ldquo;slicer&rdquo; program that generates the path for the 3D printer
has a much larger influence on the eventual object than what is specified in the
3D model I try to print. It was a process of trial and error right at the edge
of the printer&rsquo;s capabilities to determine the exact settings that would work.
In the end, I created a profile of printer settings specifically for this job,
featuring extremely low speeds and a moderate-but-not-too-fine layer height. Using
these settings increased the time to print a small block by a factor of about 12,
from 5 minutes to just over an hour, but gave me the extra precision I needed.</p>

<p>My last attempt at programming before I gave up on hookup wire was with the block
that held tiny loops of wire onto the pads. This at least came close enough to
working that I was able to test the programming process. Unlike the development
boards I was used to, which can be programmed with a USB cable and a computer,
the ESP-12 module lacks the special chip that converts the USB protocol spoken
by the computer to the serial protocol needed by the chip. This means that you
need an intermediate chip to perform this function, and you need to wire it into
a circuit with the chip you want to program. This programming chip also allows you
to listen to any messages the chip might send out. There were a few times when I
was able to pick up garbled signals on the serial line when I reset the chip. Even
though it wasn&rsquo;t actual text, it made me think I was on the right track.</p>

<p>When I had tried and failed with every configuration I could think of with the
materials I had on hand, I went back to researching existing designs. It was then
that I discovered &ldquo;pogo pins&rdquo; which as the name suggests are small, spring-loaded
pins used in professiona bed of nails testers. They&rsquo;re fairly inexpensive&ndash;I got
100 in the size I needed for about $12 including shipping without looking too
hard for deals.</p>

<p>When the pogo pins arrived, it was 2 weeks after I had first started this project,
and I had been slowly ramping up the seriousness with which I was approaching
the design. At the beginning I was focused on finding quick wins, and I had
been rewarded by learing a lot about the circuit layout and programming requirements
in a very short time, but had no luck with the actual programming. Now I was
ready to drop into a lower gear and plan a little more carefully to ensure a result.</p>

<p>I settled on a design based around a small assembly in which I soldered one pogo pin
to a length of hookup wire, then covered the joint in shrink-wrap insulation.
On the other end of the wire I attached a female Dupont connector. Making 16 of these
small assemblies took about 2.5 hours, but at the end, when I tested them for
continuity from the spring-loaded tip to the end of a wire attached to the Dupont
connector, I was confident that I had the building blocks of a reliable system.</p>

<p>A few more experiments began to suggest the best-yet design for the bed of nails.
It would use a block that fit exactly around the ESP-8266 chip, with holes guiding
the pogo pins down exactly onto the pads. Surrounding that would be a pair of plates
connected by screws, so that the whole system, relay and all, could be held in place
and the pins clamped down onto the pads to ensure a good connection.</p>

<p>Finally, I was ready for a test. Previously, I had used the reset pad as a test method.
I knew that shorting the reset pad to ground should have made the board reset, which
looked like a few flases of the blue onboard LED followed by a blue pulse. But
now, when I grounded the reset pin, a red LED came on, and none of the blue ones did.
By trial and error, I realized that if I did not make the specified connection between
GPIO 16 and ground during startup, the regular reset would happen. But if GPIO 16
was connected to ground as instructed, only the red light came on. When I looked
back at the instructions, I realized that this was good news. The reason that GPIO
16 is supposed to be held low is that booting in that configuration puts the chip
into programming mode. What I was seeing was that the chip was ready to be programmed.</p>

<p>I hooked up the bed of nails to the chip again. I hooked up the wires to the programmer.
I hooked up the programmer to the computer. I had a small test step that &ldquo;blinked&rdquo; GPIO 12&ndash;
the relay control pad&ndash;on a two-second cycle. I clicked to program the board, and I almost
couldn&rsquo;t believe it when the upload proceeded smoothly and finished successfully. When
I looked over at the board, the red LED that mirrored the relay state was slowly flashing
on and off. I put the plastic cover back on, plugged in the relay, and plugged a light into
it. Click. The light went on. Click. The light went off. Click. Click. Click. I just
watched it for a while. Then I ordered a few more relays :-).</p>
